# howmuchfruit
Have you ever wanted to know, how much you weigh. But in fruit?

I wanted to create an application that converts people weights from KG, Stone or pounds into the fruit per piece equivalent. Check it out live at howmuchfruit.com

This application uses HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 

I used a json file to store all the data needed to convert the measurements and then used the bulit in fetch api to get that data once the user submitted their info.
